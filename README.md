This part explains how to use the editor tool to create or edit a tree. <br/>

## Open Tree Editor

Opening the tree editor is fairly simple : go to Window, and the TreeEditor. <br/>

## Presets

One of the possibilities the tool gives you, is to save and load tree presets in the form of a ScriptableObject. <br/>

With the button "LoadPreset", you can choose a preset to use.

With the button "SavePreset", you can save changed parameters into the last loaded preset.

And lastly, with the button "Create Preset", you can, well, create a preset with the current parameters.

## Parameters

A lot of parameters are involved in the creation of the tree.
I will let you discover. But once you have finished tweaking the parameters, don't forget to press the "Generate Tree" button. <br/>

## Mesh

Once you are satisfied with your settings, you can save the mesh with the button "Save Mesh". <br/>

## Controls
As seen previously, while in the editor, you can modify parameters that will be propagated on the screen, but you can also control the camera of said screen : <br/>
- Mouse wheel -> zoom in/zoom out.
- Maintain mouse left click -> control camera rotation.
- Maintain mouse right click -> control camera position.
