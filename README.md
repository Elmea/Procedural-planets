### Open Tree Editor

Opening the tree editor is fairly simple : go to Window, and the TreeEditor.

### Presets

One of the possibilities the tool gives you, is to save and load tree presets in the form of a ScriptableObject.

With the button "LoadPreset", you can choose a preset to use.

With the button "SavePreset", you can save changed parameters into the last loaded preset.

And lastly, with the button "Create Preset", you can, well, create a preset with the current parameters.

### parameters

A lot of parameters are involved in the creation of the tree.
I will let you discover. But once you have finished tweaking the parameters, don't forget to press the "Generate Tree" button.

Once you are satisfied with your settings, you can save the mesh with the button "Save Mesh".
